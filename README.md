Mockingjays
========================

*Mockingjays* is a proxying tool that responds to requests with responses that have been
previously observed.

*Mockingjays* acts as a mock server for previously seen requests and captures
new request for future use.

## Command Line
### Install Mockingjays
```bash
npm install -g mockingjays
```

### Start Mockingjays
```bash
mockingjays \
  --port=9000 \ # Port that the proxy server should bind to.
  --cacheDir=/var/app/fixtures \ # Place where cached responses are stored.
  --serverBaseUrl='http://swapi.co' \ # Place where an unseen request can be learned.
  # Optional Settings
  --ignoreContentType='image/*,text/html' \ # Skip Cache on any Image and HTML document.
  --refresh=true # Always Visit the Source for a Newer Response
```

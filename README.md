*Mockingjays* is a proxying tool that responds to requests with responses that have been previously observed.


![Mockingjays](https://www.dropbox.com/s/srlu5oev0t3dof1/Mockingjays.png?dl=1)

*Mockingjays* acts as a mock server for previously seen requests and captures new request for future use.

## Install Mockingjays
```bash
npm install -g mockingjays
```

## CLI Use
```bash
mockingjays \
  --cacheDir=/var/app/fixtures \ # Required
  --serverBaseUrl='http://swapi.co' \ # Required
  --cacheHeader='authorization,content-length'
  --ignoreContentType='image/*,text/html' \
  --port=9000 \
  --refresh=true \
```

## Programatic API
```javascript
var Mockingjays = require('../mockingjays')
new Mockingjays().start({
  cacheDir: '/var/app/fixtures', // Required
  serverBaseUrl: 'http://swapi.co', // Required
  cacheHeader: 'authorization,content-length',
  ignoreContentType: 'image/*,text/html',
  port: 9000,
  refresh: true
});
```

## Options

- **serverBaseUrl** -Place where an unseen request can be learned.   
  - ***Required***
- **cacheDir** - Directory where request/response data should be stored.
  - ***Required***
- **cacheHeader** - Headers that should be considered as part of the cache signature. By default all headers are ignored in the cache signature.
  - *Default: ''*
- **port** - Port that the proxy server should bind to.
  - *Default: 9000*
- **ignoreContentType** - Comma separated list of content-types that should be skipped. This can include a `*` which will be a wildcard match equivalent to the `.*` RegEx. No File Types Ignored by default.
  - *Default: []*
- **refresh** - Indicates if the request/response cache should be updated unconditionally.
  - *Default: false*
- **responseHeaderBlacklist** - Indicates headers that should not be recorded to the cache file. Things like date or fields that may change the file during refreshes are ideal candidates.
  - *Default: []* (Record all headers)



## Cached Responses

The root of cached responses specified by the `cacheDir` option. Each response
is then stored in a subdirectory that matches the path for the request.

For example, a request to the path: `/api/` when the `cacheDir` option has the value of `/var/app/fixtures`
will be stored in `/var/app/fixtures/api/{sha1_request_hash}` where `sha1_request_hash` is a
hash value of the http request.

Request with deeper paths such as `/api/people/1/` will create a deep directory structure
inside the root of the `cacheDir`.

### Cached Responses

Each cached response has the following format:
```javascript
{
  "request": { /* Request Being Proxied */ }
  "status": 200, /* Response Status Code */
  "type": "application/json", /* Response Content Type */
  "headers": { /* Response Headers */ }
  "data": { /* Response Payload */ }  // Can be object or string base on content type
}
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "request": {
    "hostname": "swapi.co",
    "port": 80,
    "path": "/api/",
    "method": "GET",
    "headers": {},
    "body": ""
  },
  "status": 200,
  "type": "application/json",
  "headers": {
    "date": "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 05:32:11 GMT",
    "content-type": "application/json",
